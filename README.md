> While discussing options available I was asked what my rating for a certain place was. They asked in the terms of "How Many Dylans?".
> This was meant to be a stab at the Michelin stars system, but I decided in the end that it would be nice to point people to something.

4. I can't fucking find X!

It probably isn't eptic. Try my [travel](http://github.com/dylanegan/travel) repository.

@DylanFM. He made the lovely imagery. He earns 3 Dylans, but because he is a Dylan too he now has 4 Dylans. Nothing else can be as awesome.

No, probably not, but I don't fucking care either.
