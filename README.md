#### Huh? What the fuck?

> I was traveling around Sweden for a [conference](http://nordicruby.org) when I was asked for a recommendation on somewhere to eat.
> While discussing options available I was asked what my rating for a certain place was. They asked in the terms of "How Many Dylans?".
> This was meant to be a stab at the Michelin stars system, but I decided in the end that it would be nice to point people to something.
